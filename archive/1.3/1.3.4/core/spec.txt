iio script specification
========================
v 1.0

Syntax

	iio script is a series of statments, which can be
	composed of one or more expressions.

	An expression can be a:
		
		definition
		assignment
		function call
		core function call
		conditional
		loop

	expressions are composed of:

		keywords
		variables
		core functions
		operators
		values

	whitespace is used to delineate expressions, statements,
	keywords, functions, and values.

Defnitions
	
	named variables are created using the 'var' keyword.

	variable definition:

		var i = value

Assignments

	values are assigned using the '=' operator.

	variable assignment:

		i = value

	variable definition and assignment:

		var i = value

Functions

	functions are variables that can be defined with 
	the 'fn' keyword. The 'end' keyword is required
	at the end of the function body.

	function definition:

		var myFunction = fn
			...
		end

	ordered parameters may be defined within trailing
	parentheses. Whitespace is used to delineate parameters.

	function with parameters definition:

		var myFunction = fn( arg0 arg1 ... )
			...
		end


Function Calls

	functions are called by adding a training parentheses to
	the function name.

	function call:

		myFunction()

	function call with parameters:

		myFunction( arg0 arg1 ... )


Core Function Calls

	core functions are called by adding the function keyword,
	a set of parameters, and an 'end' keyword

	core function call:

		set 
			value
		end

Value Function Calls

	value functions are called with their function keyword
	and one or more parameters

	value function call:

		random 0 to 100
